        <h2>UXD Student</h2>
        <p>Hello, Welcome to my portfolio website!
            I am currently a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, majoring in User Experience Design. I am very hard working and persistent on something that I love to do. I can understand people in English and fluently speak it as if it is my first language. Being able to do make up and digital design, which I learned by myself, is also something I’m good at and proud of.</p>
